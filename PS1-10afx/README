Robert Quimby has now shown it to be a lensed SN Ia

These are three-column: wavelength, flux, error.  I think the MMIRS data are in vacuum wavelength and the others are in air. 

The IAU standard for conversion from air to vacuum wavelengths is given in Morton (1991, ApJS, 77, 119). For vacuum wavelengths (VAC) in Angstroms, convert to air wavelength (AIR) via:

AIR = VAC / (1.0 + 2.735182E-4 + 131.4182 / VAC^2 + 2.76249E8 / VAC^4)
